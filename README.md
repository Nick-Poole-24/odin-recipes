# 🍝 Odin Recipes This is my very first project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) Foundations course. It’s a simple multi-page website built entirely with HTML that showcases a collection of my favorite recipes. 
## 📚 What I Learned - Writing clean and semantic HTML - Creating multi-page websites - Linking between internal pages - Embedding images and structuring lists - Organizing project files and folders 
## 🛠️ Tech Used - HTML5 - Git & GitHub (for version control and sharing)
