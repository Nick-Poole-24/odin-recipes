        <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 Cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
            <li>3/4 Cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>1/2 Cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 large egg yolk</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 heaping cup dark chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
  
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the melted butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar.<br>
                Add the egg and the egg yolk and whisk until well combined and no streaks of egg <br>
                white remain. Whisk in the vanilla.</li>
            <li>Add dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix with a spatula. <br>
                when the dry and wet ingredients are mostly combined, add in the <br>
                chocolate chips and mix until a soft cookie dough forms and no <br>
                dry flour remains.</li>
            <li>Cover and refridgerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 2 days. <br>
                Cookie dough just chilled for 30 minutes will yield flatter <br>
                cookies that spread more as bake. Cookie dough chilled for 2 hours <br>
                or more will yield thicker cookies that spread less.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350Â° and line two large baking sheets <br>
                with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Use a 2-tablespoon cookie scoop to scoop the dough on to <br>
                baking sheets leaving at least 2 inches between cookies. <br>
                Bake one sheet at a time, for 9 to 11 minutes, or until the <br>
                edges of the cookie are golden brown but the tops will look <br>
                underdone when you take them out of the oven, but they will <br>
                set up as they cool. </li>
            <li>Let cool on baking sheets for 10 minutes before transferring <br>
                to a wire rack to cool completely</li>
